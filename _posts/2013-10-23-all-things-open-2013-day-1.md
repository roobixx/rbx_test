Now to the highlights&#8230;.

Python #FTW

If you are having a bad day then your code is having a bad day.

When is a tree not a tree? When you see it as a system.

You can use your mind to control a skateboard in 28 lines of code&#8230;..I checked

The next great idea is my responsibility&#8230;.I got this

Drupal 8 looks fierce&#8230;.but I still am a Joomla! homer

Best line of the Day
